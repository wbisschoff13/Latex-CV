  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Developed applications for an Espressif microcontroller using embedded C/C++ and ESP-IDF.
      \item Utilized a highly configurable BLE stack for  communications in the ESP environment for low-energy data transmission
      \item Leveraged Python to manage serial and BLE communications for seamless device interaction; Python was also used to create executable programs for client-side testing, enabling application functionality verification
      \item Set up a mock implementation of hardware functionality using Python. This simulated environment allowed for quick testing and development without the need for physical hardware.
      \item Managed specified data interchange through a lightweight, compact binary framing protocol, ensuring fast and compact data transfers.
      \item Implemented asynchronous development practices using promises and event listeners.
